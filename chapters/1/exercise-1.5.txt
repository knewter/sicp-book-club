(p), being a function that returns itself, when 'fully expanded' as described
in the normal-order evaluation, should simply return itself.  Since it is not evaluated
until the last necessary moment, the method should return 0.

On the other hand, if using applicative-order evaluation, 'evaluate the arguments
and then apply' will never complete because (p) is a valid method call with zero 
arguments.  It will recursively call itself forever, and since we evaluate the
arguments first, it will never complete.
